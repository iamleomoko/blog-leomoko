Greetings! I'm Liyolo Metsing Moko, a curious spirit on an unusual adventure that has brought me down fascinating roads and molded my perspective in extraordinary ways.

From the start, I stood out as someone who saw the world through a distinct perspective. While other children played together, I found myself pursuing lonely experiences, learning to observe and understand the world around me in my own unique way. Raised in a large family by my late grandmother, I was embedded with ideals that taught me the value of individualism and self-discovery.

Growing up, I learned that my hobbies differed from the usual, and this is where my fantastic journey actually began. I dabbled in sports, technology, and even attempted some daring karate moves (which did not always end well). My late older brother, a computer enthusiast, exposed me to the world of computing, kindling a passion within me that would determine my future activities.

As I delved deeper into the world of computers, I became fascinated by the art of spotting patterns and recognizing gaps in various facets of life. This passion with discovering hidden opportunities led me to imagine a world in which innovation and technology could bridge those gaps and enrich our communal experiences. When I saw "The Social Network" in 2010, a flame was sparked, and I felt an overpowering drive to create and develop.

My favorite subject in high school was Computer Application Technology (CAT), which only reinforced my ambition to pursue a career in technology. University became the next step, a place where I could hone my talents and knowledge while prepared to start on a journey to alter industries and integrate new solutions.

After graduation, I entered the business sector, hoping to obtain practical experience before embarking on the development of ground-breaking products and systems. However, the restrictions of a 9-to-5 schedule felt oppressive, as if I were surrendering my soul for a wage. This period of hardship led me down a path of self-discovery, where I studied philosophy and the complexity of human nature. I realized that the moment had come to pursue my aspirations, therefore I chose to break free from corporate shackles.

Today, I find myself on a great journey of adding value to various industries while being true to the essence of human nature. My purpose is to unlock the potential of both technology and the human spirit, allowing us to enjoy the many fruits that the planet has to offer. I am deeply committed to creating a world in which technology and human harmony coexist smoothly.

Join me on this transforming journey as we explore the unknown frontiers of innovation, creativity, and the limitless potential that we all possess.

Sincerely, <br />
Moko, Liyolo Metsing <br />
