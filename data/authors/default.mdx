Greetings! I'm Liyolo Mesting Moko, commonly known as Leo Moko, an inquisitive soul embarking on an uncommon journey that has taken me down strange paths and shaped my perspective in surprising ways.

I stood out from the start as someone who saw the world through a different perspective. While other kids played together, I went on lonely expeditions, learning to observe and understand the world around me in my own unique way. I was raised in a large family under the guidance of my late grandmother, who instilled in me the value of individualism and self-discovery.

My interests veered from the norm as I grew older, and this is where my remarkable journey actually began. I dabbled in sports and technology, as well as some daring karate moves (which did not always end well). My late older brother, a computer fanatic, was the one who introduced me to the world of computing, sparking a passion in me that would shape my future activities.

As I became more immersed in the world of computers, I became fascinated by the art of spotting patterns and identifying holes in various facets of life. This interest with unearthing hidden potential inspired me to imagine a world in which innovation and technology could bridge those gaps and enrich our social experiences. When I saw "The Social Network" in 2011, it struck a spark in me, and I felt an overpowering drive to create and build.

My favorite subject in high school was Computer Application Technology (CAT), which only strengthened my resolve to pursue a career in technology. The next step was university, where I could hone my abilities and knowledge while prepared to start on a journey to restructure industries and integrate new solutions.

After graduation, I entered the corporate industry, hoping to obtain practical experience before embarking on the creation of ground-breaking products and systems. The restrictions of a 9-to-5 structure, on the other hand, felt oppressive, as if I were sacrificing my soul for a paycheck. This period of hardship led me on a journey of self-discovery, during which I studied philosophy and the complexity of human nature. I understood that the time had come to pursue my aspirations, and In July 2023, I chose to break free from corporate constraints.

In July 2017, one year after joining the corporate world, I took a risk and resigned to pursue my entrepreneurial passion. As a result of this, [Cqudefus](https://www.cqudefus.com/), a software development company, was founded. Despite the challenges, I returned to the corporate sector in 2018 to gain further experience due to the need for a better understanding of the industry. Nonetheless, I continued in my goals, dedicating countless hours after work to honing my skill.

In 2020, I started organizing my massive vision into a coherent whole. As a result, [FirstEleven Inc](https://www.firsteleven.co.za/). was established as a holding company for a variety of products and services. This was a watershed moment in my life since it reaffirmed my commitment to have a long-term impact on industry and society as a whole.

In my personal time, I enjoy a variety of artistic endeavors. I take consolation in books, discovering new worlds through literature. I let my creative soul run wild while I paint on canvases, bringing my thoughts and emotions to life. In addition, I use a camera to freeze time and preserve memories by capturing ephemeral moments of beauty.

Fast forward to March 2023, and the time has come to present [Heavy App](https://www.heavy.com.co/), one of [FirstEleven Inc](https://www.firsteleven.co.za/app/heavy/).'s key products. This was an incredible accomplishment, the result of years of hard work, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication. Heavy App is the coming together of my dreams and my constant quest of perfection.

Join me on this life-changing journey as we explore new frontiers of invention, creativity, and our collective boundless potential.

Sincerely,<br />
Liyolo Metsing Moko <br />
(Leo Moko)
